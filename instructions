Six shows: Two in July, two in August, two in September.

Ayrazarrr: I need the average of the best two scores per horse/rider combination per division. Where the two scores have to be from two different shows

So the competition is by division and then test.
Division would be introductory, training, first, second, third, fourth, Prix st George, intermediate and Grand prix
[10:08 AM] Ayrazarrr: Test within division doesn't matter for my purposes

 So Jr's will be awarded separately from open/aa
[3:31 PM] Ayrazarrr: JR/YR is one category, and open or AA are one other category.

My notes
--------
Get the best score per horse/rider combination per division per show.

Average the top two scores from different shows.

Divisions: Introductory, Training, First, Second, Third, Fourth, Prix St. Georges, Intermediate and Grand Prix
// const divisions = ["Introductory", "Training", "First", "Second", "Third", "Fourth", "Prix St. Georges", "Intermediate", "Grand Prix"];

Adult Amateur and Open go together. JR/YR on it's own.
